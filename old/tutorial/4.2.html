<span ng-show="tldr41">
<ul>
<li>NPCs are Generated with full family backgrounds</li>
<li>Many of the random stats can be re-generated or locked (by clicking the lock icon)</li>
<li>The twisting arrow icon in the upper right (below the first row of fields) randomizes any non-locked down feature or trait</li>
<li>Clicking on spouse, mother, or father (if present) will load that NPC into the details pane</li>
<li>Details and notes can be manually changed and saved as the PC's get to know the NPC.</li>
<li>Under "Extended Details" you can make an NPC imortal, exclude them from automatic processing, and set whether they have met the party yet. (Be aware of a quirky functionality.  The scrolling code I am using doesn't triger when you click "extend details".  You have to move your mouse out of the area and back in.  This is on my fix list.)</li>

<p ng-hide="tldr41">Here are the full NPC details with an array of generated aspects and features.  Each NPC also potentially has a spouse, mother, father, and siblings all with their own details work up.  Currently manually adding spouses or family is not supported, but it is planned in the near future.</p>
<p ng-hide="tldr41">A living family member's name will be Green, if they have passed away it will be black. Clicking the name of the spouse or parent will take you to their details.  Also hovering over their name will give you some basic details like whether they are alive, their age, and their race.</p>
<p ng-hide="tldr41">The details with the "lock/unlocked" icon next to them can be randomized (if unlocked) by clicking the twisted arrow icon in the upper right.  All of the details and traits can be customised for your account when you generate your worlds.</p>
<p ng-hide="tldr41">Finally, in the extended details section you can change the region the NPC lives in, their bith year, and their generation (be advised, NPC's are cleared after they are 10 generations behind the most current one).  The other options in the extended detials are: Immortal, which means an NPC will not die of old age, Excluded: which means they are not aged or processed through any of the civilization code when a region is "aged", and Met Party: which is just an easy way to track whether the NPC has met the party yet.(Be aware of a quirky functionality.  The scrolling code I am using doesn't triger when you click "extend details".  You have to move your mouse out of the area and back in.  This is on my fix list.)</p>
