<p ng-hide="tldr20">Monsters/Characters (Actors) are added by the quick menu ("+" in upper left) or by the "Monster" side bar (seen in step 1 of tutorial). This combat board tracks everything you would expect: Status, HP, Initiative, Round, etc.  Plus has additional information close at hand like AC and Initiative.  The selected row will also show more details in the combat details section (covered later)</p>
<p ng-hide="tldr20">The buttons at the top are "+" used to quickly add a generic Actor, "Add Group" to add a group of Actors to the combat board, "Clear" which will clear the combat board, and "Start Combat" which resets to the first round and orders by initiative.</p>
<p ng-hide="tldr20">there are also right click context menus.  If you right click anywhere OTHER THAN the HP field you will get a menu including various actions like saving throws for actor or the whole table, remove actor from the table, or adding a persistent effect (ongoing damage, status effect, etc).  If you right click on the HP field it gives you a quick menu for adding or subtracting HP.  Try them out!</p>
