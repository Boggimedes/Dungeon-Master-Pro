<p ng-hide="tldr10">I know we just added Monsters to the combat board, but we will get to that in a minute.  There are (probably) hundreds of different combat/campaign managers for tabletop roleplaying games out there, but none that help you create audio atmosphere to enrich your games. The goals of the sound system are meant to serve those who don't have a lot of time to invest into creating sound scapes, but also serve those who want something that truly creates a custom experience for their players.</p>
<p ng-hide="tldr10">The audio code will adapt to however many speakers you have, but the sound is truly amazing when you have 5.1 surround or above.  The code will take advantage of those speakers and play tracks that are set as "random" at various speaker positions and distances to create a very real sounding ambience that never becomes repetative. </p>
<p ng-hide="tldr10">The buttons to the right play different scenes that include anywhere from just one sound, to upwards of a hundred.  You can create your own custom sound scenes, but the basics are provided for you so you can dive right in.  Up to 5 "scenes" can be playing simultaneously, but usually no more than 1-3 are needed depending on how you are using them. Right click on a scene to bring up its options where you can adjust things on the fly like which sub-effects will play, and at what volumes.  "On the fly" changes do not effect a sound that is CURRENTLY playing, so you would have to stop the effect and re-start.</p>
<p ng-hide="tldr10">Groups of sounds are organized into "Collections".  These can represent whatever you like, but the design is for a collection to serve a campaign or genre. eg. "Medieval Collection", "Modern Collection", "Space/Sci-Fi Collection", etc.</p>
