<li>Record of combat rolls and status</li>
<li>Can roll with Advantage or Disadvantage with the up or down arrow buttons</li>

<p ng-hide="tldr21">Combat log tracks and reports actions in combat.  The two button sets at the top are for selecting the attack or skill for the creature that is active in the table above.  The first attack of the creature will generally be selected automatically, but the dropdown includes Multiattacks, Abilities, and even Spells!</p>
<p ng-hide="tldr21">Multiattacks, Spells, and Abilities will have sub-menus to select.  Currently Legendary Actions are represented by a "L" after the attack name.  "L" Means it takes 1 Legendary action point, "L2" takes 2 points, etc.</p>
<p ng-hide="tldr21">If you do not plan on using Advantage or Disadvantage these buttons can be disabled in the account settings section.</p>
