<h1>Welcome to the Tutorial</h1>
<p>This page is pretty complex as I am trying to pack in as much functionality as possible.  Unfortunately this makes it more difficult to make all the features intuitive.  If you have any suggestions or questions they are always welcome.  Email me at Boggimedes@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Ok, to start with click the "Monster" Menu in the upper right then double click a few monsters to add them to the combat board. It is that easy to add combatants! Also keep in mind you can filter monsters by name and/or by CR</p>
