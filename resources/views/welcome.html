        <p>
          Welcome to GameMaster.pro (GMP)! I am a single developer with a very
          understanding spouse and daughter who started this project nearly a
          decade ago. Back then this was primarily built in excel and was not
          nearly so feature rich, but the concept originated from there. My goal
          was a system that made MY style of tabletop gaming easier. I say "my
          style" because there are a multitude of ways to play a tabletop RPG
          game, and the parts of the game that receive the focus can vary
          widely. Anyone who has been playing for a while has been in games
          where 90% of the session was spend on the combat board, and perhaps
          games where the combat board is only seen once every few sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is "my style" you ask? I like to call it "Collaborative
          Storytelling". My focus is on not just telling a good story, but doing
          so in partner with the players. In order to facilitate that; my games
          are far less scripted. I tend to prepare worlds/characters more than
          specific sessions, and story arcs unfold based on the player actions,
          not in predetermined paths. Finding a system that helped enough, but
          not too much wasn't an option back then, so I built my own. GMP can
          accomodate more styles than just mine, but its origin and focus is on
          storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of GMP is to provide infinite story/worldbuilding ideas, and
          help keep the mechanics of gamplay in the background. What makes GMP
          different than others that I have seen? Two words: NPC Generation. Ok,
          I guess that technically 4 words, but the point is GMP focuses on
          generating interesting and unique NPCs with more backstory than some
          player characters.

                <h4>Generated World Maps</h4>
                Maps are procedurally generated vector graphics for each
                region/island based on Azgaar's amazing
                <a href="https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/"
                  >Fantasy Map Generator</a
                >. Realistic natural land shapes with climate and biome to
                match. Cultures, Governments, and Religions can all be set to
                expand and grow organically. Diplomatic relations are created
                when governments meet. Cities and points of interest are spread
                throughout the land with corresponding generated story hooks.

                <p>
                  NPCs aren't just generated, they live lives and have families.
                  Each region is seeded with NPC's then "Aged" a few
                  hundred/thousand years. Each year is "lived" by each NPC. They
                  get jobs, meet, marry, have children, and die. They pass on
                  traits like demonic or angelic lineage, they occasionally
                  contract Lycanthropy, and their children are more likely to
                  follow in their footsteps (professions can run in families).
                  The system keeps up to 10 generations. When you need an NPC
                  you get a smattering of physical traits, profession, family
                  relations, and so much more.

                <p>
                  Combat and skill rolls are a click away. Monster attacks are
                  calculated/rolled automatically from a single click, and on
                  the fly rolls are just as easy. The system is based in d20
                  with optional advantage/disadvantage. Track initiative, hit
                  points, turn order, status effects. Combat is a breeze with

        <h3 class="card-title">FAQ</h3>
        <h5>Why this?</h5>
        <p>
          Because I wanted it. No, really, I'm doing this for my personal use
          first and foremost.
        </p>
        <h5>Are you planning on charging? When?</h5>
        <p>
          It really depends on popularity. If enough people want to use it, I
          may charge a small fee. If it grows enough I would have to start
          charging, or at least request donations or add "feature upgrades".
        </p>
        <h5>How much?</h5>
        <p>
          Not a ton. I'm thinking $1.50 - 2.50/mo or $15 - 20/yr. I would much
          rather have 1000 users paying $1 than 100 users paying $10.
        </p>
        <h5>Does your system work with xyz?</h5>
        <p>
          Unless its d20, nope. Or at least not yet. If there is enough interest
          I am willing to support any system.
        </p>
        <h5>Timeline?</h5>
        <p>
          If there isn't much interest then my progress will be slower. I'm
          perfectly willing to use my product even if it's buggy, but if others
          are relying on it for their games I'll be more motivated.
        </p>
        <h5>
          What features are planned/implemented that aren't in the
          video/screenshots?
        </h5>
        <pre class="text-primary">
- Campaign/Story sharing
- Color/Pallet customization
- Timeline, plot points, and marker visibility
- Rule/System reference (perhaps editable for house rules)
- Quick generate NPC class from selected class and level (including npcs in combat becomes a snap)
- Add more systems and sample worlds/campaigns
        </pre>
        <h5>You seem a little... casual. No offence, but is my data safe?</h5>
        <p>
          Does a dragon hoard treasure? Ok, bad example because that does vary
          by mythology. While this may be my side project, I am a Senior Full
          Stack developer. No shifty adventurers are getting this dragon.
